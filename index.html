                Our garbage cleaners need sponsors to provide food to the poor who help us collect garbage or provide money to encourage garbage collection. On the other hand, if we provide enough food for them They are sure that they will be interested in the environment, especially the garbage problem around their living environment. In addition, they are also a factor in promoting the garbage problem in Cambodia. For example, they can volunteer to guide others who do not yet understand the garbage problem.
